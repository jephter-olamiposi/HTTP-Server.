# HTTP-Server.

"A simple HTTP server  built from scratch, covering some intriguing topics youâ€™ll encounter:

 - Using enum and struct effectively to structure your code, with insights on the correct way to use match expressions and how if let works.
 - Understanding lifetimes to manage data ownership and borrowing across function boundaries.
 - Serving HTML files and handling file I/O for static content delivery.

# How an HTTP Server Works:

An HTTP server listens for incoming requests, processes them to determine the requested resource or action, and responds with data (like HTML, images, or JSON) or an appropriate status code. It handles connections over TCP and follows the HTTP protocol to communicate with clients, typically web browsers."
